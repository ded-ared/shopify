# How to enable and set up Sticky Widget

**Sticky Widget** is a nifty and convenient tool that gives you access to the search box and stays visible on the storefront no matter how far you have scrolled a page.

Since **Sticky Widget** is an integral part of [Smart Search & Instant Search](https://apps.shopify.com/searchanise), you need to have this app installed before using the widget.   
**Sticky Widget** is customizable. Use the admin panel to set up some of its features the way you prefer.

Here is how to enable and customize the widget:

1.	Navigate to the **Apps** section in the left side menu.
2.	Find and click **Smart Search & Instant Search → Instant Search Widget** in the list of installed apps.
3.	Enable **Instant Search Widget** if it’s off.

4.	Optionally tick the box **Optimize for phones and tablets**.
5.	Go to the **Sticky Widget** tab.
6.	Choose how **Sticky Widget** should appear on the page:   
    
    •	**Auto** — the widget appears on the page automatically if there is no search box available.   
    •	**Always** — the widget is on the page no matter if there is a search box available or not.   
    •	**Never** — the widget is always hidden.   
    
    ⚠ Note. **Auto** and **Always** modes demand **Search Results Widget** enabled.

7.	Choose the widget color by the method you find the most convenient:   
    
    •	pick it up in the color square;   
    •	insert the color code if it’s known;   
    •	click **Reset** button to reset to the default color.   

8.	Choose the widget position on the storefront:   
    
    •	top-left;   
    •	top-right;   
    •	bottom-left;   
    •	bottom-right.

9.	Optionally you can change the text in the **Search Input Placeholder** (that’s what customers would see in the search box), or leave it empty.
10.	Click **Apply Changes** in the top-right of the screen.   

You can change the settings any time you want. Just go to the **Sticky Widget** tab, change the settings you need and save them by applying changes.
