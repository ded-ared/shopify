# How to enable and set up Sticky Widget

**Sticky widget** is a nifty and convenient tool that gives you access to the search box and stays visible on the storefront no matter how far you have scrolled a page.

Since **Sticky widget** is an integral part of [Smart Search & Instant Search](https://apps.shopify.com/searchanise), you need to have this app installed before using the widget.   
Sticky widget is customizable, so you can set up some of its features the way you prefer.

Here is how you can enable and customize the widget.

1.	On the left side menu go to the **Apps** section.
2.	In the list of installed apps find and click **Smart Search & Instant Search → Instant search widget**.
3.	Enable **Instant search widget** if it’s off.

4.	Optionally check the box **Optimize for phones and tablets**.
5.	Go to the **Sticky widget** tab.
6.	Choose how the Sticky widget should appear on the page:   
    
    •	**Auto** — the widget appears on the page automatically if there is no search box available.   
    •	**Always** — the widget is on the page no matter if there is a search box available or not.   
    •	**Never** — the widget is always hidden.   
    
    ⚠ Note. **Auto** and **Always** modes demand **Search Results Widget** enabled.

7.	Choose the widget color by the way you find the most convenient:   
    
    •	pick it up in the color square;   
    •	insert the color code if t’s known;   
    •	click **Reset** button to reset to the default color.   

8.	Choose the widget position on the storefront:   
    
    •	top-left;   
    •	top-right;   
    •	bottom-left;   
    •	bottom-right.

9.	Optionally you can change the text in the **Search input placeholder** (that’s what customers would see in the search box), or leave it empty.
10.	On the top-right of the screen click **Apply changes**.   

You can change the settings any time you want. Just go to the **Sticky widget** tab, change the settings you need and save them by applying changes.
